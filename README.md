# pam_properteries_editor
a python script that turns .pam ((p)opcap (a)ni(m)ation) files into a json,  
then lets you edit that json with a "pick an option number" type of command line utility.  
after you are done, it will encode the json file back into a .pam file for you.  
  
(currently unfinshed, the first version should be done very soon)
